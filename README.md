## Food Oracle

Food Oracle is an app that suggests recipes based on the ingredients that are available in a user’s virtual refrigerator/pantry. Our target market is primarily college or university students whose limited time requires the need for them to prepare quick, tasty and healthy meals, anytime of the day. Our app’s main purpose is to suggest recipes based on the user’s preferences, allowing them to start and finish cooking their meals in a short timeframe. This app is being developed using [React Native](http://www.reactnative.com) mobile framework, and [Yummly's food API] (https://developer.yummly.com) for recipe finding purposes.
